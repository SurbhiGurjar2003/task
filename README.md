# Text Classification API using Flask and Hugging Face
This project is a simple Flask REST API for sentiment analysis using a pretrained NLP model from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

It accepts input text via a POST request and returns the predicted sentiment (POSITIVE or NEGATIVE) along with the confidence score.

Uses distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english for sentiment analysis.
This uses Hugging Face's default sentiment analysis model.
